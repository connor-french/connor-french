## Hi, I'm Connor!

I am a research scientist and recently earned my PhD in the Mike Hickerson and Ana Carnaval labs at The Graduate Center, City University of New York.

Iâ€™m currently on the job market! My ideal role would involve taking advantage of my **strong computational and scientific background** to solve difficult data problems in business and science. I love each stage of the process- planning, execution, and communication to stakeholders. Through my PhD I gained extensive communication skills through my participation in the [Graduate Center Digital Fellowship](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), a technical think tank for the university. I am particularly drawn to mission-driven companies that can take advantage of my **domain-specific knowledge in genomics, climate, and/or geospatial analytics**, but I am open to taking my passion for data science and analytics into unexpected directions. As a data scientist, **I particularly enjoy creating reproducible data analytics and machine learning pipelines, creating engaging data visualizations and dashboards, and distilling complex results for a diversity of stakeholder audiences**.

My academic research focuses on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve in response to changing environments. I integrate species distribution modeling using earth observation data with population genomics to address these questions and develop open-source software to facilitate the scientific community's ability to solve these difficult problems.

Iâ€™m passionate about data science, photography, music, and my dog Buckley!
