## Hi, I'm Connor!

I love to use data to answer difficult questions across a variety of fields, from biology to business. I am especially passionate about tackling problems that have a geospatial or genomic component, leveraging my experience with geospatial statistics, bioinformatics, and familiarity with earth observation data.
